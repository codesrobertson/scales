  <h3>Your Analyzed Search Result</h3>

  <h5><span class="Category-highlight">Domain</span> </h5>
  <p>Scales categorizes your link's domain as most frequently publishing <span class="Result-highlight"> {{ domain_category }}</span> content.</p>
  
  <h6>Why does the domain matter?</h6>
  <p>You wouldn't put on Cartoon Network if you were hoping to see a war movie. Similarly, understanding the type of content your media outlet is in the business of purveying can help ensure your news is from a news source to begin with.</p>

  <!-- Add in section with media literacy flashcards here -->

  <h5><span class="Category-highlight">Title</span> </h5>
  <p>Scales reports that the overall sentiment of your link's headline is <span class="Result-highlight">{{ title_decision }}</span>; and scores <span class="Result-highlight">{{ title_score }}</span>.</p>

  
  <h6>How are scores determined?</h6>
  <p>Scales' machine learning model and sentiment analyzer use scales of 0-1 (with 0 being the most objective(factual), and 1 being the most subjective(biased).) In other words, a straightforward news story will return with a score closer to 0, and an opinion piece will return with a score closer to 1.</p>


  <h5><span class="Category-highlight">Content</span> </h5>
  <p>Scales reports that the overall sentiment of your url's content is <span class="Result-highlight">{{ content_decision }}</span>; and scores <span class="Result-highlight">{{ average_bias }} </span>.</p>

  <h6>How much is bias?</h6>
  <!-- add loop or enumerator for however the percentages break down -->
